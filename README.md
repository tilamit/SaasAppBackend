1) A grid is shown in a web page and it shows details like who are paid users or vice-versa. A form is given for initial entry of a user

2) A check box indicates if checked, then user is a paid user or vice-versa. If user is unchecked and requires to be a paid user, then tick on the check box in the grid and a
   database should be generated in Azure with a row in `Users` table (Will take a bit). On the other hand, if user is checked which indicates paid user and requires to be in free trial mode, then uncheck the check box. 

3) To verify a new user created, refresh the web page
